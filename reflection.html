        <h1 class="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p class="reflection">I choose the topic of researching a variety of different diseases and the vaccines that are required to go to school or travel to different countries.
             I found this topic interesting after the last two year of following with covid and the protocol in place and now the vaccines with the booster coming out.
              This is an important topic as this is something we deal with on a daily basis throughout this assignment I evaluated information about different common viral infection that many people experience in their lifetime.
               Some common viral infection includes Whooping cough, common flu and more. The website gives an interactive look into these infection with common symptoms, what ages people should get the vaccine for the disease, and more.
                I also put in a whole page dedicated towards what vaccines are and how they work. I then went into depth about who should and shouldn't get vaccinated against the disease or who should see their doctor before doing so. 

        </p>
        <p class="reflection">From doing this project I have learned a lot from all about the diseases and their vaccines that go along with them.
             I did not know about all the different types of vaccines that there could be for one virus or disease, such as the Live-attenuated vaccines are just weakened forms of the germ that is inactivated.
             I also learned all the symptoms so that I can be more informed when it comes to recognizing if someone has a certain virus.
        </p>
        <p class="reflection">I hope that by doing this project others can see the importance of being vaccinated against serious
            viral infections and take action.
