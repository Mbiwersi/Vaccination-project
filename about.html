        <h1 class="vaccine">What are vaccines?</h1>
        <p class="vaccine-description">Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. For example, there are vaccines to protect against:

            Viruses, like the ones that cause the flu and COVID-19
            Bacteria, including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis
            What are the types of vaccines?
            There are several types of vaccines:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="vaccine-description">
            Live-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the germ
            Inactivated vaccines use a killed version of the germ
            Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, such as its protein, sugar, or casing
            Toxoid vaccines that use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ
            mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA, which gives your cells instructions for how to make a protein (or piece of a protein) of the germ
            Viral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells.
            Vaccines work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response. The immune response is the way your body defends itself against substances it sees as foreign or harmful. These substances include germs that can cause disease.
