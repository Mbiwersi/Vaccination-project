                <p>
                    <li>IPV is the only polio vaccine that has been used in the United States since 2000.</li>
                    <li>It is given by shot in the leg or arm, depending on the patientâ€™s age.</li>

                    <li>This vaccine is no longer licensed or available in the United States.</li>
                    <li>It is still used in some parts of the world.</li>
                    <li>Children receive doses of the vaccine by drops in the mouth.</li>

                <h2>Children</h2>
                <p>Children in the United States should get inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to protect against polio, or poliomyelitis. They should get four doses total, with one dose at each of the following ages:</p>
                <h2>Adults</h2>
                <p>Most adults do not need polio vaccine because they were already vaccinated as children. But three groups of adults are at higher risk and should consider polio vaccination in the following situations:</p>

                <h1>Who should NOT get the Polio Vaccine</h1>
                <h2>If the person getting the vaccine has any severe, life-threatening allergies</h2>
                <p>If you ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of IPV, or have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, you may be advised not to get vaccinated. Ask your health care provider if you want information about vaccine components.</p>
                <h2>If a persona gettting the vaccine is not feeling well</h2>
                <p>If you have a mild illness, such as a cold, you can probably get the vaccine today. If you are moderately or severely ill, you should probably wait until you recover. Your doctor can advise you.</p>

                <h1>Possible side effects</h1>
                <p>
                    <li>People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>Some people get shoulder pain that can be more severe and longer-lasting than the more routine soreness that can follow injections. This happens very rarely.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.</li>
