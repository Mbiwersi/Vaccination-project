                <h1>What is it?</h1>
                <p>Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).
                    It can cause an itchy, blister-like rash. The rash first appears on the chest, back, and face, and then spreads over the entire body, causing between 250 and 500 itchy blisters.
